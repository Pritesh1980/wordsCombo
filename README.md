Word Combination Generator

This project generates 6 digit numbers from words such that A=1, B=2...J=10, K=1 etc.
Additionally, it takes a 6 digit number and works out the possible words that this could have come from.

It is a simple app, mostly used so I can test unit testing frameworks, code coverage and profiling tools as well as various CI/CD pipelines - local and on Cloud platforms.
